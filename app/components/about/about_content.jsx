        <p className="pt-6">
          Over the past four years, I have gained extensive experience with a
          diverse array of technologies in my role as a developer. My
          self-motivation drives me to continually learn and improve, enabling
          me to work effectively both independently and as part of a team.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4">
          I am passionate about designing visually appealing interfaces,
          developing web applications, and everything in between. Outside of
          work, I enjoy traveling, playing video games, and listening to music.
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4">
          Currently, I am living in Spain, and I am available for work. If you
          have an <span className="text-red-800">open position</span> or a
          project you would like to discuss, feel free to contact me.
