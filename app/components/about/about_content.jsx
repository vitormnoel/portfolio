          Over the past four years, I have gained extensive <span className="bg-yellow-100 px-1">experience with a
          diverse array of technologies</span>{" "}in my role as a developer. My
          self-motivation drives me to continually learn and improve, enabling
          me to <span className="bg-sky-100 px-1">work effectively both independently and as part of a team.</span>
        </p>
        <p className="pt-4">
          I am passionate about designing visually appealing interfaces,
          developing web applications, and everything in between. Outside of
          work, I enjoy traveling, playing video games, and listening to music.

          Currently, I am living in Spain, and <span className="bg-green-100 px-1">I am available for work.</span> If you
          have an <span className="">open position</span> or a
          project you would like to discuss, feel free to contact me.
